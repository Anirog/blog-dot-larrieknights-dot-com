I made some custom coloured folder icons in [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com) my favourite design tool.

**Setting custom icons for your folders in macOS is easy.**

1. Download any of the .png files below to a folder on your Mac.
2. Select the .png file and press `Command + C` to copy it.
3. In Finder select the folder you want to customise and press `Command + I` to open the Info window.
4. Click the little icon in the top left corner, and hit `Command + V` to paste it.

That's it! ðŸŽ‰
