I made some custom coloured folder icons in [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com) my favourite design tool.

**Setting custom icons for your folders in macOS is easy.**

1. Download the [folder-icons.zip](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1DjYow8ha1fgSczL-CujC5dj38s4IaIMV) file.
2. Unzip the file.
3. Select the .png you want and press `Command + C` to copy it.
4. In Finder select the folder you want to customise and press `Command + I` to open the Info window.
5. Click the little icon in the top left corner, and press `Command + V` to paste it.

That's it! ðŸŽ‰

To go back to the original icon select the folder you customised, press `Command + I` to open the Info window, click the little icon in the top left corner, and press delete.
