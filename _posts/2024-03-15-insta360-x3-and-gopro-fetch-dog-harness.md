I recently got myself an Insta360 X3 camera and wanted a way to safely mount the camera on my dog, I found the perfect solution using the GoPro Fetch Dog Harness and the Insta360 Quick Release mount.

The GoPro harness has the standard 3 pin mount on the top and the quick release mount has 2 fold out pins that fit into these 3 pins, the pins on the mount also fold up so it can be attached to a tripod with a standard 1/4 inch thread.

The magic of the Insta360 stitching process makes the camera disappear when exported, so in the image below my dog is wearing the camera but you can't see it ðŸ˜€
