I recently got myself an Insta360 X3 camera and wanted a way to safely mount the camera on my dog, I found the perfect solution using the GoPro Fetch Dog Harness and the Insta360 Quick Release mount.

The GoPro harness has the standard 3 pin mount on the top and the quick release mount has 2 fold out pins that fit into the 3 pins, the pins on the mount also fold up so it can be attached to a tripod with a standard 1/4 inch thread.

Here's a video I made using the Insta360 and the dog harness
