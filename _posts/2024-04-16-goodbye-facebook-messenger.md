My frustrations with Facebook Messenger began with its latest update introducing end-to-end encryption. While I value the added security, the problem arose when it became apparent that if any of my contacts hadn't updated the app, I wouldn't see their messages and they wouldn't see mine.

I appreciate the intention behind this new feature, but the execution seems flawed. It's disheartening to think that a simple app update could sever communication with friends. In response, I've removed Messenger from all my devices. Surprisingly, I haven't found myself missing it.
