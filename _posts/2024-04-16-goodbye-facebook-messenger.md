I've been having ongoing problems with Facebook Messenger, it started after the latest update that included the new end-to-end encryption. 

Now I'm all for end-to-end encryption, but the issue with how Facebook has rolled this out is that if any of your contacts haven't updated the app, you won't see their message and they won't see yours.

To me, this is a terrible way to roll out a new feature, so I uninstalled Messenger on all my devices and haven't missed it so far.
