I was inspired by the first paragraph of Being There by Jerzy Kosinski

> Plants were like people, they needed care to live, to survive their diseases, and to die peacefully.
>
> Yet plants were different from people. No plant is able to think about itself or able to know itself; there is no mirror in which the plant can recognise its face; no plant can do anything intentionally: it cannot help growing, and its growth has no meaning, since a plant cannot reason or dream.
