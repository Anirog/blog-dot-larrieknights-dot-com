I was watching Gogglebox today, I like the brother and sister Pete and Sophie Sandiford, on today's episode they were watching 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?' and Pete said a classic line.   

> Life isn't always about money, but have you ever seen anybody sad on a jet ski? So money can buy you happiness.

>   â€” Pete Sandiford
